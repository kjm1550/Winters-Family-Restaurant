# Winters Family Restaurant

This is a live web site for Winters Family Restaurant in Pembine, WI. This web site has been designed to be easy to read and appreciable interface for potential customers of Winters Family Restaurant. A API feed of Winters Family Restaurant's Facebook page has been added to provide up to date information. As well as an API integration for Google Maps to allow directions to the restaurant.

The client was in need of a web site that would allow potential customers to look up hours open, contact information, and a menu. In a way that will convert potential customers into actual customers. They also wanted the web site to be simple and reflect the theme and feel of the restaurant, wooded small town family restaurant. To do this, I kept the colors and layout simple but appealing so it would stand out. The basic information is highlighted with green and is the first thing people visiting the web site see. Using flexbox, I finished the layout with a photo slideshow, Facebook feed block, and a Google maps block. The slide show has some photos the client thought highlighted the family feel of the restaurant and their many food options.

After the web site was pushed live the client has heard positive remarks from customers as well as an uptick in new customers. The client is very happy with the site and loves having this be a web site for their restaurant.
